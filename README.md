# Test_Data
The R Code generates six data frames () with four variables each, depicting two dimensional clusters of various shapes. Each of the data frames containes two or three clusters with 400 or 600 data points per cluster making up a total of 1200 data points per data frame in total.
For the ease of use, all data frames are further combined to one data frame (AllClusters). The data of AllClusters (seed(1)) is contained in the AllClusters.csv. 

__Description of the variables__
 Class: Describes the belonging of the data (x,y & z) to one of six datasets. 
 x: X-Coordinate
 y: Y-Coordinate
 z: Describes the belonging of the data point to a certain cluster.
